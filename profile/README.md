Take control of your Xcode environment with CodePurge. This all-in-one tool not only handles cleanup for archives, derived data, and documentation caches, but also introduces powerful tools to:

- Identify device support files recently used by Xcode to ensure safe removal of unused files.
- Manage bloated simulators, including SwiftUI Preview simulators, which can consume significantly more storage than core iOS simulators.
- Clean up the global Swift Package Manager cache, allowing you to remove outdated or unnecessary repositories.

The project is built with modularity in mind, consisting of a standalone app and two publicly available Swift packages.

## Features

**Test Mode and Live Mode**  
CodePurge offers two modes of operation to suit your workflow:
- **Test Mode**: Explore the app's capabilities without making any changes to your system.  
- **Live Mode**: Erases the data from selected simulators and moves everything else to the trash bin.

**Clean Up Xcode-Generated Files**  
CodePurge makes it easy to identify and clean up unnecessary files generated by Xcode, such as:
- **Archives**: Remove old and unused archives to reclaim storage space.  
- **Derived Data**: Free up space taken by build artifacts and debug files.
- **Documentation Cache**: Delete outdated API documentation to optimize storage without affecting development workflows.

**Device Support Management**  
Unused device support files can quickly clutter your storage. CodePurge:
- Identifies device support files recently used by Xcode.  
- Separates unused files from active ones, allowing you to safely clean up unnecessary versions.

**Simulator Management**  
Simulators, especially those for SwiftUI previews, can occupy significant disk space. CodePurge provides tools to:
- Manage core iOS simulators used for testing and debugging.  
- Handle SwiftUI Preview simulators, which often consume **10x the storage** of core simulators, ensuring your environment stays optimized.

**Swift Packages Cache Cleanup**  
CodePurge allows developers to manage the global Swift Packages cache by:
- Identifying unused or outdated repositories.  
- Removing unneeded package repositories to free up valuable disk space.

## Who Should Use CodePurge?

- **iOS Developers**: Simplify the management of Xcode-generated files and reduce wasted storage.
- **Anyone Looking to Optimize Xcode**: CodePurge is an invaluable tool for those who want to focus on development without worrying about cluttered files.
